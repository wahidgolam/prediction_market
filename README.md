# Prediction Market - Logarithmic Bonding Curve on Anchor

## Intro

$`reserve = b.ln(e^(supply_x/b)+e^(supply_y/b))`$


This equation has to hold true for all values of supply_x & sypply_y, and the change in reserve caused by the change in supply_y or supply_x, is paid by the user, where the price becomes:


$`price = (reserve_new - reserve_old)/(supply_new - supply_old)`$


The initial reserve to be filled while creating the market = $`b.ln2`$
